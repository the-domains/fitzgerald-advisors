Fitzgerald Advisors, LLC helps banks mitigate credit risk, clean their balance sheet, & relieve regulatory pressure by ​selling off their challenged loans & REO Assets. There is a time chart of delinquency from early stages ( 30-89), to severe (90+) to very problematic (non-accrual) to zombie status (REO) where the borrower's loan loses its heartbeat d​ue to hardship & the bank, in essence, clears the title, repossesses & foreclose's on the asset, & takes back the collateral as bank owned property. Our role is to help the bank maximize recovery by loan/asset sales. We specialize in all loan/asset types that you will see on a bank's quarterly call report. Which can range from 1-4 Residential (including Junior Lien's Open Ended & HELOC'S), Construction, Land Development, Multi-Family, Commercial Real Estate, Farm Agriculture, Commerical & Industrial, & even consumer loans like revolving credit cards.
